    "text": "Main Sections\nThe OSAA Research Guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for conducting applied research within the context of a knowledge broker organization, such as OSAA. The purpose of these guidelines is to establish a common methodological approach for gathering, processing, translating, and building awareness of existing trustable evidence, ultimately contributing to evidence-informed policy development in Africa.\nThe guidelines cover the entire knowledge output development process, including preliminary research, analysis planning, data inventory, and output development. By following a structured approach, OSAA staff can ensure consistency, transparency, and credibility in their work, maximizing the impact and aligning with the organization’s strategic goals.\nPreliminary Research is vital for identifying research gaps, guiding analysis planning, and enhancing research relevance. Key components of preliminary research include literature review, stakeholder analysis, preliminary data analysis, and defining the study scope and objectives.\nThe guidelines also present a detailed process for developing an Analysis Plan. Emphasis is placed on the importance of a conceptual framework, which provides a theoretical foundation for the research study. It is crucial to identify and articulate assumptions underlying the research to ensure transparency and clarity. Research Design and Research Methods are distinguished sections, with research design referring to the overall structure and plan of the study, while research methods are specific techniques used to collect and analyze data. The selection of appropriate research methods is essential for addressing research questions and hypotheses.\nData Inventory is a crucial step in identifying and gathering information about relevant data sources, both internal and external. Staff members should prioritize public, freely available country-level data and clearly identify any non-public data needs as risk factors.\nThe Output Development section focuses on the core components of a policy analysis output, including foundation, argumentation, and conclusion. The executive summary holds paramount importance, as it succinctly summarizes the main points and recommendations for busy readers.\nThe guidelines also provide a comprehensive list of document formats used within the context of OSAA’s knowledge production work, including studies, policy papers, policy briefs, and snapshots. This section includes suggested output components for each document format.

    "text": "1.2 Evidence-based Knowledge Brokerage\nAs OSAA seeks to solidify its role as a knowledge broker organization, the specifics of what this means can be visualized as follows:\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Knowledge Brokerage\n\n\n\nCuration: OSAA prioritizes synthesizing a vast array of evidence and data that exists in the public domain (within or outside the United Nations). This process involves not only selecting the most pertinent (trustable) sources but also doing so according to a purposefully crafted policy narrative, which aligns with its stakeholders’ interests (i.e., OSAA’s Strategic Clusters’ Framework and the USG’s Strategic Guidance). This careful information curation process ensures that OSAA presents the most significant and relevant information to its stakeholders, in accordance with OSAA’s own strategic criteria and narratives.\nProcessing: OSAA endeavors to process this data into a robust, actionable framework for decision-making, monitoring, and evaluation. This consists of:\n\nCombining the data into a cohesive set of related and trustable data, ready for analysis.\nUncovering relationships, patterns, and trends from the curated data, and developing well-founded hypotheses on the underlying mechanics of cause and effect.\n\nTranslation: OSAA strives to extract meaningful insights, construct a clear narrative, and contextualize the relationships, patterns, and trends uncovered from the curated information.\n\nOSAA understands the value of cohesive and empirical data, recognizing that it is not only the gathering of data that is important, but how it is combined and used that truly makes the difference. This enables the office to provide comprehensive advisory and advocacy services, with the ultimate goal of aiding the formulation and implementation of effective, evidence-based policies in Africa. By doing so, OSAA turns evidence into actionable knowledge, helping its stakeholders navigate the complexities of the African context and make informed decisions that drive impactful change.",

    "text": "1.3 Elements of an Effective Research\nAn effective knowledge product comprises two essential components: the research question and the corresponding answer. The research question poses an inquiry to be addressed, such as verifying a theory, a hypothesis, or an assumption, evaluating a policy, assessing a body of evidence on a specific matter, or exploring the relationship between policy issues.\nBeyond the research question, a research output typically includes additional elements. Firstly, it is crucial to provide a rationale for the chosen question before delving into its exploration (i.e., the substantiation). Secondly, the output should explain the methodology employed to address the research question. Following this, the output proceeds to present the findings, which ultimately lead to the answer to the research question.\nAn OSAA adaptation to these elements is presented in the Core Components of a Policy Analysis Output section. It is intended to be more suitable to a knowledge broker role, tasked with producing knowledge outputs for policy monitoring, advocacy, advisory, and coordination, as is the case of OSAA.",

It involves gathering relevant information, exploring existing knowledge, and identifying gaps in the current understanding of the topic. The key components of preliminary research include:\n\nLiterature Review: Conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature, academic publications, reports, and other relevant sources to gain a thorough understanding of the topic. This step helps identify existing theories, concepts, data sources, bibliographic references, and methodologies related to the field of study and provides a foundation for further analysis.\nStakeholder Analysis: Identify and engage with key stakeholders who have expertise or interest in the research area. This may include policymakers, practitioners, subject matter experts, and individuals or organizations directly impacted by the research topic. Understanding stakeholders’ perspectives and needs can guide the research process and ensure its relevance and applicability.\nPreliminary Data Analysis: Research available quantitative studies related to the research topic. This can include analysis reports on existing datasets, surveys, case studies, or other relevant information sources. Preliminary data analysis helps identify previously reported evidence of relationships, patterns, trends, and potential areas for further investigation.\nStudy Scope and Objective Definition: Outline what the research aims to achieve and the boundaries within which it will operate. This includes:\n\nResearch Objectives: Establish clear and measurable research objectives that align with OSAA’s strategic goals and the USG’s strategic guidance. These objectives should outline the desired outcomes of the research and guide the entire research process.\nResearch Scope: Determine the specific focus of the study by clearly defining the boundaries of the research area. This includes identifying the target population (and any gender, class, or age segment criteria), geographical location, time frame, and other relevant parameters that define the scope of the research.\nResearch Questions: Develop specific research questions that address the gaps in understanding identified during the preliminary research phase. These questions should be focused, relevant, and aligned with the research objectives. They act as a guide for the research process and help researchers stay focused on the purpose of their study’s narrative.",

    "section": "2.3 Designing an Analysis Plan",
    "text": "2.3 Designing an Analysis Plan\n\n2.3.1 Research Design\nResearch Design vs. Research Methods\n\n“Research design is a plan to answer your research question. A research method is a strategy used to implement that plan. Research design and methods are different but closely related, as good research design ensures that the data you obtain will help you answer your research question more effectively.” — Research Methods Guide: Research Design & Method, Virginia Tech\n\nResearch design, also known as research methodology, concerns the various aspects which should be considered when carrying out a research project. It involves turning research questions into research projects and primarily deals with goals, purposes, intentions, and plans while considering practical constraints such as location, time, and resources.\n There are a number of research design models. The one presented in the image above (on the left) is a simple framework by Robson & McCartan (2016) 1. The model (on the right) has been adapted to OSAA’s procedures in two ways:\n\nTo exclude sampling concerns, as OSAA staff are not expected to conduct statistical surveys.\nTo combine the purpose and conceptual framework into one Conceptual Note element, as is OSAA’s current practice (see section above for details on the Conceptual Note).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOX 1: Research Design vs Research Methods\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Design VS Research Methods: what are the main differences?\nResearch Design refers to the overall structure and plan of the study, including:\n\nDeciding on the research objectives and approach (quantitative, qualitative, case study, etc.).\nDetermining whether primary or secondary research will be conducted.\nIf primary research is conducted, specifying the data collection methods and procedures.\nDefining the research/data analysis methods.\n\nResearch Methods are the specific techniques used to collect and analyze data, such as:\n\nSurveys\nInterviews\nStatistical analyses\nLiterature reviews\nDiscourse analysis\nExploratory data analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Conceptual Note\nThe Conceptual Note establishes: 1. Purpose: What the study aims to achieve (describe, explain, or understand a phenomenon) and relates back to the study’s scope and objectives. 2. Conceptual Framework: The concepts, theoretical foundation, mechanics, and assumptions that contextualize and guide the research, helping to interpret the findings.\nThe conceptual framework provides a structure for organizing ideas, ensuring coherence in the research design and analysis by: - Guiding the research: Developing a clear understanding of the relationships and concepts that underpin the research. - Informing hypotheses: Outlining key variables, their interrelationships, and the expected direction of effects.\n\n2.3.2.1 Identifying and Articulating Assumptions\nAssumptions are the presuppositions that underlie the conceptual framework. They are beliefs the research relies on but does not verify. Identifying and articulating these assumptions ensures transparency and clarity, helping stakeholders understand the analyst’s perspective and ensuring that the study’s objectives and outcomes are aligned.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Research Method Selection\nThe selection process involves determining the most appropriate approach to address the research questions and hypotheses, considering factors such as:\n\nThe nature of the research topic (exploratory, descriptive, or explanatory).\nAvailable resources (time, budget, and access to data).\nTime constraints.\nThe desired level of detail and accuracy in findings.\n\nCommon research methods include:\n\nQuantitative Methods: These involve collecting numerical data and analyzing it using statistical techniques. Quantitative methods are useful for measuring and analyzing relationships, patterns, and trends.\nQualitative Methods: These focus on gathering non-numerical data, such as interviews, focus groups, or textual analysis. Qualitative methods provide in-depth insights, capturing perspectives, experiences, and contextual nuances.\nMixed Methods: These combine quantitative and qualitative methods, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the research topic. Mixed methods can provide a deeper exploration of complex phenomena. This can be achieved by a back and forth analysis of underlying patterns, trends and relationships, through quantitative analysis, combined with in-depth exploration of cause-and-effect mechanisms behind these trends, through study case analysis.\n\nThe Research Methods Guide: Research Design & Method, by Virginia Tech, presents a non-exhaustive list of methods’ options, of which these are the most likely options in the context of OSAA’s work:\n\nNon-household surveys. These may be conducted to collect information on African countries not included on public/paid country data available online, or otherwise. For instance, maintaining an updated database with historical information on all ODA concessional loans in Africa. Some crucial information may not be systematically collected by any other sources at this point.\nInterviews and/or focus groups may be conducted with experts, stakeholders, field staff (UN or National Governments), etc.\nSecondary Data Analysis, one common method currently applied at OSAA, as the main focus of the organization has been to leverage the vast amount of information already produced within the data ecosystems of the United Nations, African Union, academia and many more.\nDocumentation review, likely the most commonly applied method at OSAA. Along with interviews and surveys, it forms the most common combination of methods for case studies.\nMixed Methods, a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, as, for instance, the combined approach of secondary data analysis and case studies. These combine quantitative and qualitative methods, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the research topic. Mixed methods can provide a deeper exploration of complex phenomena. This can be achieved by a back and forth analysis of underlying patterns, trends and relationships, through quantitative analysis, combined with in-depth exploration of cause-and-effect mechanisms behind these trends, through study case analysis.\n\nThe possible combinations can be extensive, and, some, uncommon. In any case of doubt, the staff member should seek out the assistance of OSAA’s Strategic Management Unit (SMU) Data team.\n\n\n2.3.4 Research Question and Hypotheses\n\n2.3.4.1 Formulating a Research Question\nResearch questions should be specific, concise, and scoped on the key aspects of the research topic. Staff members should ask themselves: what needs to be known in order to achieve the purpose(s) of the study? Is that feasible to ask given the time and resources available?\nFormulating clear research questions is essential for guiding the research process and addressing the objectives of the study. They provide a focused direction and serve as a roadmap for the investigation and help staff stay on track throughout the study. When formulating research questions, also consider the following:\n\nEnsure clarity: Research questions should be concise, specific, and clearly articulated. They should address the key issues or gaps in knowledge, identified during preliminary research, and the discussion presented in the conceptual note.\nEstablish relevance: Research questions should align with the strategic objectives and guiding principles of OSAA. They should aim to deliver on the USG’s strategic guidance and provide actionable insights to inform decision-making.\n\n\n\n2.3.4.2 The Relationship Between Research Question and Hypotheses\nResearch questions and hypotheses are closely related components of the research process. Research questions outline the overall inquiries to be addressed, while hypotheses are specific statements that propose relationships or predictions about variables in the study, which the study aims to test or, simply, investigate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOX 2: Variables vs Indicators\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of the data work at OSAA, a variable is defined the same as a column (aka an attribute) in a spreadsheet. For instance, in a table with country data (i.e. each row is a different country) and a column with each country’s GDP value, aptly named “GDP”, “GDP” is a variable. It is called a variable because, even though it measures the same phenomena (the country GDP), it varies from country to country (or from row to row). An indicator may be the equivalent to a variable (GDP can itself be an indicator) or require computation from more than one variable. In the same example, to get the “GDP per Capita” indicator, one must compute it using both the “GDP” and “Population” variables.\n\n\n\nHypotheses provide a more precise and testable framework for data collection and analysis, supporting the research questions by offering specific propositions (i.e. predictions) to be evaluated.\nIn summary:\n\nResearch Questions These guide the overall inquiry and investigation. They are broad and open-ended, seeking to explore and understand a particular aspect of the research topic.\nHypotheses These are specific statements or assumptions derived from the research questions. Hypotheses provide a testable proposition about the relationship between measures (i.e. variables). They help researchers frame their analysis and provide a structured approach to answering the research questions.",

This helps ensure that the necessary information is available for subsequent stages of analysis, i.e., the in-depth research.\n\n3.2.1 Steps in Developing a Data Inventory Annex\nDetailed instructions are provided in the Data Inventory Template in the Annex. In general, however, the information on data (i.e., the metadata) collected in the data inventory can be classified into two categories:\n\nSource Metadata: Identifies the specific formats in which the data is available, such as spreadsheets, databases, text files, CSV, PDF, or APIs.\nData Metadata: Identifies the relevant measures, type (numerical, text, or categorical measures/variables), indicators, and visuals for the list of research questions and assumptions identified during the analysis planning phase.",

This approach promotes transparency, reproducibility, and the use of reliable data, while also highlighting any potential challenges or gaps that may arise from limited access to certain datasets.\nWhen opting to work with non-public data, staff members should also consider the legal and ethical implications of accessing this restricted data, as well as ensure compliance with relevant regulations and obtain appropriate permissions, if necessary.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Core Components of a Policy Analysis Output\nTo help set a fluid flow for the document, it is suggested that staff members start by presenting the research substantiation. This is an opportunity to expand on the conceptual note and anchor the output on the USG Strategic Guidance.\nSecondly, authors should present and discuss the findings of their analysis while supporting their claims with evidence. This should be achieved either by presenting specific data, references, or quotes, or by arriving at logical conclusions based on previously introduced evidence. Expert opinions can, and should, be presented, but they should be coupled fairly with the evidence provided in the document. It should not be expected of the audience to simply “take your word for it.”\nFinally, the concluding remarks should serve to clearly and concisely emphasize the main messages or insights that the analysis aims to elucidate.\n\n\n3.1.2 Practical Contributions\nHere are a few key attributes to keep in mind at each stage. These are not compulsory and should be regarded as simple advice, to be taken on if perceived as helpful:\n\n3.1.2.1 Substantiation\nThis segment expands on the conceptual note. It starts with an exposition on the importance of the topic, followed by a literature review that identifies existing theories, conflicts, or gaps leading to the research question. Finally, the research question (and corresponding hypothesis, if applicable) and an outline of the document are presented. The introduction section follows a progressively narrowing approach, starting broadly and gradually focusing on the research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus on defining the problem or issue. Emphasize its priority or gravity level and objectively present the evidence landscape to persuade the audience that this is a priority, and why. Prioritize objectivity, reserving your voice for the discussion phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2.2 Discussion\nThe discussion section serves two primary objectives: 1. To demonstrate that the research provides a convincing answer to the posed question. 2. To illustrate the value of that answer.\nThe discussion section may begin with a brief summary of the research methods and results (if applicable). This is followed by an interpretation of the findings, explaining their significance and whether they support the hypothesis or if there could be other explanations.\nOften, a section is dedicated to discussing the limitations of the study. This includes acknowledging the weaker aspects of the research and assessing whether these limitations invalidate the conclusions or if they can still be drawn despite the limitations. This should be optional and decided on a case-by-case basis, considering the specifics of the work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyze, do not merely present the data. Your conclusions should make sense of the (quantitative or qualitative) data presented.\nDevelop a theory of change that connects your arguments to your conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2.3 Conclusion\nThe final segment of the discussion section is the summary and conclusion. This component aims to encapsulate the learnings from the research and delineate the subsequent steps or recommendations. The significance of this section lies in its position as the final part of the document that readers will engage with. Readers often jump directly to this section to glean a summary of the research’s insights. If they find the summary compelling, they may invest time in reading the entire article. Therefore, it is advisable to begin with the research question, swiftly move to the results, bypass the method, and dedicate more space to reiterate the key insights, implications, and the value of the research. Mentioning limitations is not recommended in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBriefly remind the audience of the overall picture: the goal of the work and the gravity of the matter. Remind the audience why the recommendations matter.\nAddress the feasibility of your recommendations and any caveats or reservations to keep in mind, if appropriate.\nProvide allies for further analysis and/or a call to action (whichever makes sense in the reasoning developed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2.4 Executive Summary\nThe executive summary leverages the expertise and credibility of the analyst and conveys key recommendations to the reader. It succinctly summarizes the main points for busy readers, while also highlighting recommendations in a memorable manner that drives future discussions. It may help to consider the perspective of the decision maker: What key points will best ensure the audience’s remembrance and understanding of the analysis arguments and conclusions?\nAs a general rule, the executive summary should not exceed five percent of the complete document. However, its length should be adjusted as necessary to effectively summarize the key points. The executive summary should be crafted with precision and conciseness, ensuring that it captures the essence of your research and recommendations. A recommended structure for this section would include summarized versions of:\n\nThe problem statement\nThe methodological approach (if applicable)\nThe key findings/recommendations\nThe main conclusions and/or implications\n\nA recommended framework approach to draft your summary is to use the journalist’s questions: “Who / What / Why / How.” 1",

    "section": "3.2 Output Standard Formats",
    "text": "3.2 Output Standard Formats\nThis section outlines the standard formats used for knowledge production within OSAA. These formats are designed to cater to different purposes, audiences, and content requirements, ensuring that the outputs are tailored to the specific needs of the stakeholders and align with the strategic objectives of the organization.\n\n\n\nKnowledge Products\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Document Formats\nBelow is a comprehensive list of document formats used within the context of OSAA’s knowledge production work. Each format serves a unique purpose and is characterized by specific length and content criteria. These clear and concise definitions aim to facilitate effective communication and understanding among the staff and all OSAA stakeholders.\n\nStudies: Long documents (approximately 10,000 words) that combine background, research, and policy recommendations.\nPolicy Papers: Longer documents (approximately 5,000 to 6,000 words) that analyze in depth a specific policy question.\nPolicy Briefs: Short, policy-focused documents (approximately 3,000 or less) that contain specific policy recommendations, normally derived from a previous Policy Paper’s concluding remarks.\nSnapshot: Short (1 page or less) and highly visual and data-based document to convey information about a specific topic. It usually summarizes findings of another written product, i.e., any of the above.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Publications & Technical Writings\nBesides these guidelines, the staff member should consider if the document is intended as a general or technical publication. Technical publications are intended for a technical/expert audience, meaning the audience is expected to have some technical background on the content of the exposé. General Publications do not assume specialized background knowledge and have greater concern with designing storytelling arcs to help persuade its broader audience.\n\n\n3.2.3 Output Functional Alignment\nA second classifier to keep in mind, other than general vs. technical publication, is to consider which OSAA function the document best aligns to. The staff members should consider if the document is intended as:\n\nA diagnostic tool that serves policy monitoring,\nAn advisory contribution to assist/inform a specific need of a specific audience, or\nAn advocacy output aiming at broadcasting and persuading a larger audience on the merits of a specific narrative being presented.\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Output Outline Framework\nThe Output Outline Framework is a structured guide designed to assist OSAA staff in organizing and presenting their research findings across various document formats, including Studies, Policy Papers, Policy Briefs, and Snapshots. The framework is visually represented in the accompanying table, which categorizes key sections of a document—such as the Executive Summary, Introduction, Methodology, Literature Review, and more—into three essential components: Substantiation, Discussion, and Conclusion. Each section is further defined with specific descriptions and aligned with the type of document to which it applies, with optional elements marked where there is flexibility. This structured approach ensures that every output is comprehensive, logically organized, and tailored to effectively communicate the research’s key messages, findings, and recommendations to its intended audience.\n\n\n\nProduct Outline Framework",

By summarizing and evaluating each source, researchers are forced to engage deeply with the material, fostering a better understanding of the topic. This process can help identify patterns, gaps, or inconsistencies in the literature, guiding future research directions.\nAn annotated bibliography serves as a tool for critical evaluation. It requires the researcher to assess the credibility and reliability of each source, honing their critical thinking skills.

    "text": "8.2 Producing an Annotated Bibliography\nTo create an annotated bibliography, one must first identify and record citations for relevant sources. Each citation is followed by a brief descriptive and evaluative paragraph, the annotation. The purpose of the annotation is to inform the reader of the relevance, accuracy, and quality of the sources cited.\nThe process of writing an annotated bibliography can be broken down into three steps:\n\nCitation: Write the citation in the correct format. This will depend on the citation style guide (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.) you are following.\nSummary: Write a brief summary of the source. This should include the main arguments, topics covered, and the purpose of the work.\nEvaluation: Evaluate the source. Consider the author’s credentials, the quality of the evidence, the objectivity of the author, and how relevant the source is to your research.\n\n\n8.2.1 Resources\nFor more guidance on writing an annotated bibliography, the following resources may be helpful:\n\nPurdue Online Writing Lab (OWL): Provides detailed guidelines on the process of writing an annotated bibliography.\nCornell University Library: Offers a step-by-step guide on how to prepare an annotated bibliography.\n\n\n\n8.2.2 The Annotated Outline as an internship deliverable\nThe development of an annotated outline (or a data inventory, for instance) would constitute excellent goals to design structured internships around. It is highly recommended that staff members leverage these and other items in the research guide as activities for students and young professionals in internship programs at OSAA.",
