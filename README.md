# OSAA Research Guidelines 

## Overview

This repository contains the official research guidelines for the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa (OSAA). The guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for conducting applied research within a knowledge broker organization. The content is structured as a Quarto book, designed to standardize research processes, enhance quality control, and ensure that OSAA outputs are aligned with the organization’s strategic goals.

The guidelines cover all stages of research, from preliminary investigations to output development, and include templates, compliance surveys, and editorial guidelines.

## Structure of the Guidelines

The guidelines are organized into the following chapters:

1. **Introduction**: Outlines the purpose and scope of the research guidelines, providing context and defining the overall goals.
2. **Preliminary Research**: Details the steps involved in identifying research gaps, guiding analysis planning, and ensuring research relevance.
3. **Research Design**: Describes the process of developing a conceptual framework, selecting appropriate research methods, and formulating research questions and hypotheses.
4. **Data Inventory**: Explains how to identify and document relevant data sources, assess data quality, and prioritize accessible public data.
5. **In-depth Research**: Provides a framework for conducting detailed analysis and developing comprehensive policy analysis outputs.
6. **Output Standard Formats**: Defines the standard formats for various OSAA documents, including Studies, Policy Papers, Policy Briefs, and Snapshots.

Additionally, the guidelines include several annexes that provide templates and tools to support the research process:

- **Research Compliance Survey**: A checklist to assess compliance with the guidelines during the research process.
- **Analysis Plan Template**: A template for creating a structured analysis plan that aligns with OSAA's strategic goals.
- **Data Inventory Template**: A template for documenting and organizing data sources.
- **Editorial Guidelines**: Guidelines for writing and formatting documents in accordance with OSAA and UN standards.
- **Annotated Bibliography**: Guidance on creating annotated bibliographies to support research efforts.

## How to Use These Guidelines

1. **Navigating the Book**: The guidelines are designed to be read sequentially, with each chapter building on the concepts introduced in the previous one. However, users may refer directly to specific chapters as needed.

2. **Templates and Annexes**: The templates and annexes are included to provide practical tools for researchers. Users are encouraged to adapt these resources to their specific needs while maintaining alignment with the core principles outlined in the guidelines.

3. **Adapting the Guidelines**: While these guidelines are tailored to OSAA’s operational context, they can be adapted to similar knowledge broker organizations or research initiatives within other contexts.
